UCSC CMPM_120 PROJECT (SPRING 2022)

Golden Castel is a unique remasked version of the original Rocket Patrol game with a few minor modifications to the game play.

The following was done step by step starting from cloning the original game from Nathan Atlice's git hub on my local computer.

## Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic (60)
- A new background was created for the game from scratch using Procreate.  (Artwork was done by me)
- A new sprite was created for the spaceship.png to represent itself as a ship. (Artwork was done by me)
- A new sprite was created for the rocket.png to represent itself as a TNT bomb. (Artwork was done by me)
- explosion.png was redesigned changing the appearance of the game using a colder color pallet.
- Rocket shot sound was replaced by the cropped version of the following .wav file: https://freesound.org/people/EverHeat/sounds/208748/
- explosion sound was replaced by the cropped version of the following .wav file: https://freesound.org/people/derplayer/sounds/587179/
- Border color was changed.
- Menu colors are completly different now and the title of the game is changed to the 'GOLDEN CASTEL' with a biref story about the game.

## Implement the speed increase that happens after 30 seconds in the original game (5)
- I added a few if statements which increases the speed of the boats to 5, 6, 7 (in order of low to high)

## Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (10)
- I created a new varaible to keep track of the time starting initially from the given starting time and reducing it over time.
