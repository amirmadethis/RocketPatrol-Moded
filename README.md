UCSC CMPM_120 PROJECT (SPRING 2022)

Golden Castel is a unique remasked version of the original Rocket Patrol game with a few minor modifications to the game play.

The following was done step by step starting from cloning the original game from Nathan Atlice's git hub on my local computer.

# Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic.
## A) A new background was created for the game from scratch using Procreate.  (Artwork was done by me)
## b) A new sprite was created for the spaceship.png to represent itself as a ship. (Artwork was done by me)
## c) A new sprite was created for the rocket.png to represent itself as a TNT bomb. (Artwork was done by me)
## d) explosion.png was redesigned changing the appearance of the game using a colder color pallet.
## e) Rocket shot sound was replaced by the cropped version of the following .wav file: https://freesound.org/people/EverHeat/sounds/208748/
## f) explosion sound was replaced by the cropped version of the following .wav file: https://freesound.org/people/derplayer/sounds/587179/
## g) Border color was changed.
## h) Menu colors are completly different now and the title of the game is changed to the 'GOLDEN CASTEL' with a biref story about the game.
